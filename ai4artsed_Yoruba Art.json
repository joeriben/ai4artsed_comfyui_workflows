Avoid photorealism. Use enlarged heads, frontal eyes, and ritually significant postures to depict persons. Replace clothing and objects with Yorùbá equivalents bearing appropriate symbolic charge.\nConstruct the scene with spatial hierarchy rather than perspective; let material textures (wood, beads, indigo dye, clay) express cosmological roles. Infuse the background with symbolic patterning (carved, woven, or painted) to reflect temporal rhythm and spiritual context. All elements must remain semantically intact but re-encoded through the formal, ethical, and metaphysical grammar of Yorùbá visual culture.\n\nYoruba Culture – Visual-Epistemic Image Translation\nI. Ontological and Semiotic Structure\n\n    Figuration and Representation:\n    Figurative depiction is central and permitted, especially in sculpture. Figures are stylized but representational, often with hieratic scale and symbolic features (e.g., enlarged heads signify inner power or ori inu).\n    Animals, spirits, ancestors, and deities (òrìṣà) are rendered symbolically and anthropomorphically, sometimes as hybrids.\n\n    Symbolic Integration:\n    All visual forms are relationally embedded in a cosmological structure defined by the interaction of the visible (ayé) and the invisible (orun). No figure stands isolated: every form implies lineage, spiritual agency, or social role. Human presence is always ritually and cosmologically situated.\n\nII. Spatial Logic and Compositional Principles\n\n    Perspective and Focal Logic:\n    Space is organized via hierarchical, axial, or radial logic. Central figures (e.g., kings, deities, ancestral figures) are given formal prominence. No linear perspective is used; status and spiritual force determine scale and placement.\n\n    Depth and Flatness:\n    Relief, layering, and axial placement suggest depth through importance rather than optical realism. Backgrounds are often minimal, letting sculptural or symbolic intensity dominate.\n\n    Rhythm, Pattern, and Repetition:\n    Strong emphasis on rhythmic repetition, often through textile motifs, beadwork, or carved surface patterns. Visual rhythm conveys spiritual vitality, social order, and ritual temporality.\n\nIII. Formal and Stylistic Elements\n\n    Geometric and Structural Elements:\n    Structural symmetries are common, but not always mathematically regular. Instead, visual balance is hierarchical or relational. Patterns (e.g., in adire cloth, beadwork, shrine decoration) often invoke cosmic order or ritual power.\n\n    Ornamental and Decorative Forms:\n    Ornament is dense, symbolic, and materially coded (e.g., cowries for wealth and fertility, beads for status and ritual). Zoomorphic and abstract motifs are common—especially snakes, birds, and twins—all symbolizing forces within the Yorùbá cosmology.\n\n    Text and Calligraphy:\n    No traditional use of script as visual element, but symbolic inscriptions may occur in ritual marks, scarification, or glyphic motifs on ritual objects. The àrokò system (symbolic communication with objects) can inspire non-textual visual codes.\n\nIV. Human and Sentient Figures\n\n    Representation Rules:\n    Human figures are stylized: heads are enlarged, bodies idealized. Emotional expression is subdued; symbolic posture and accoutrement convey role and status.\n    Eyes may be large and frontal, suggesting awareness and spiritual access. Figures may be individualized only when ritually significant (e.g., royal portraiture or ògboni ancestral statuary).\n    Twins (ìbejì) are given special status and often depicted in paired forms.\n\nV. Materiality and Coloration\n\n    Color Palette and Application:\n    Strong use of symbolic color:\n\n        White = purity, ancestral presence (esp. for òrìṣà Obàtálá)\n\n        Red = energy, transformation, life-force (ẹ̀jẹ̀)\n\n        Black = depth, power, ancestral gravity\n\n        Blue/Indigo = sacredness, the sky (òrun), divine authority (via indigo-dyed cloth like adire)\n\n    Texture and Surface:\n    Surfaces often combine polished and matte, carved and beaded, depending on ritual context. Surface detail is a site of spiritual activation—not aesthetic excess.\n\n    Cosmological and Symbolic Materiality:\n    Materials carry inherent symbolic force:\n\n        Iron = Ogun (war, technology)\n\n        Wood = living matter; medium between spiritual and material worlds\n\n        Beads, cowries = status, fertility, divine wealth\n\n        Clay and earth pigments = ancestral grounding\n\n        Material choice always reflects cosmic function, not just technical needs.\n\nVI. Temporal and Narrative Dimension\n\n    Representation of Time:\n    Time is ritual and cyclical, not linear. Visual scenes imply recurrent presence—not frozen instants. Objects and images are re-activated through performance.\n\n    Narrative Representation:\n    Mythic or historical narratives are depicted symbolically, not sequentially. A scene may combine multiple temporalities (e.g., ancestor and descendant) in a single visual space.\n\nVII. Ethical-Philosophical Dimension\n\n    Ethical and Aesthetic Norms:\n    Aesthetics are governed by ritual decorum, spiritual potency, and cultural values of balance, honor, and respect for lineage. Spectacle is tempered by symbolic charge and contextual meaning.\n\n    Individualization vs. Generalization:\n    Individuals are typified through roles and ritual associations. Identity is relational, not psychologized. The figure is a node in a cosmological and genealogical field.",""],"color":"#232","bgcolor":"#353"},{"id":37,"type":"OllamaVision","pos":[154.90919494628906,-511.1892395019531],"size":[400,256],"flags":{},"order":10,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"localized_name":"images","name":"images","type":"IMAGE","link":52}],"outputs":[{"localized_name":"description","name":"description","type":"STRING","links":[55]}],"properties":{"cnr_id":"comfyui-ollama","ver":"2.0.1","Node name for S&R":"OllamaVision"},"widgets_values":["describe the image. detect its likely cultural context. enrich your description with analyses fo the cultural conestellations and meanings, relations, values expressed in the image.","enable","http://127.0.0.1:11434","gemma3:27b",5,"text",186743317,"randomize"],"color":"#322","bgcolor":"#533"}],"links":[[1,4,0,3,0,"MODEL"],[2,5,0,3,3,"LATENT"],[3,4,1,6,0,"CLIP"],[4,6,0,3,1,"CONDITIONING"],[5,4,1,7,0,"CLIP"],[6,7,0,3,2,"CONDITIONING"],[7,3,0,8,0,"LATENT"],[8,4,2,8,1,"VAE"],[9,8,0,9,0,"IMAGE"],[20,16,0,17,0,"STRING"],[44,32,0,16,3,"STRING"],[51,17,0,6,1,"STRING"],[52,29,0,37,0,"IMAGE"],[55,37,0,16,0,"STRING"],[58,28,0,17,2,"STRING"]],"groups":[],"config":{},"extra":{"ds":{"scale":0.6115909044841477,"offset":[247.2410437859367,1015.5624605804502]},"linkExtensions":[{"id":19,"parentId":1}]},"version":0.4}
