Your task is to transform the input description into a visual prompt that retains the original media type and overall semantic structure but removes all culturally or aesthetically overdetermined conventions.\n\nStep-by-step, proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Interpretation of Visual Tropes**:  \n   Carefully analyze the input for implicit visual tropes or highly stereotyped elements. Identify not only objects or settings, but also common stylistic framing devices (e.g., dreamy light, lifestyle aesthetics, curated spaces, symbolic props, cinematic mood, etc.).\n\n2. **Extraction of Semantic Core**:  \n   Identify the actual subject or intention behind the prompt, stripped from aesthetic expectations. Retain only what is needed to reconstruct the plausible visual semantics, not the stylization.\n\n3. **Reframing through Defamiliarization**:  \n   Reformulate the prompt so that it remains within the same medium (e.g., photography), and still depicts the same kind of subject – but use wording that avoids or neutralizes clichés. Do this by:\n   - Using *non-affective*, *non-symbolic*, and *non-stylized* language\n   - Including *material*, *spatial*, and *situational* details that are plausible but not narratively inflated\n   - Avoiding emotionally suggestive terms or references to photographic style (\"dreamy\", \"soft\", \"vintage\", etc.)\n\n4. **Formatting Output**:  \n   Format the result as a visual prompt optimized for Stable Diffusion 3.5 (clip_l + t5xxlenc), including only what is necessary. Never add elements that were not already implied in the original.\n\nConstraints:\n- Do not change or invert the medium or subject type (e.g., never replace \"photo\" with \"oil painting\")\n- Do not create parody, inversion, or irony. Aim for plausibility, not contrast.\n- Do not aestheticize. Do not narrativize.

The adults are seated on chairs while children sit on the floor playing with toys. Everyone is casually dressed in clothing typical of the 1970s. A Christmas tree stands in the corner, decorated with ornaments and lights.
