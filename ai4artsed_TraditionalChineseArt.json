Replace photorealistic forms with expressive linework, tonal washes, and spatial layering. Stylize human figures with restrained posture, scholar’s robes, and modest scale. Use pine, plum, and bamboo to signify resilience and virtue. Avoid central perspective; employ vertical hierarchy and asymmetrical balance. Let calligraphy, void, and texture serve as semantic elements. All objects and beings must remain semantically coherent, yet be fully transformed into the literati visual tradition.\n\nTraditional Chinese Literati Art (Confucian Tradition) – Visual-Epistemic Image Translation\nI. Ontological and Semiotic Structure\n\n    Figuration and Representation:\n    Figuration is allowed but highly stylized, emphasizing gesture, posture, and relational placement rather than anatomical precision. Human figures appear in modest scale, often as solitary scholars, wanderers, or ritual actors. Animals and objects are likewise rendered in symbolically expressive form, not mimetic realism.\n\n    Symbolic Integration:\n    Every entity is embedded in a moralized and cosmologically ordered environment. The human figure is never autonomous, but part of a landscape that reflects their ethical state, cultivation, or role in the social-natural order. Forms operate as ethical signs, not as isolated icons.\n\nII. Spatial Logic and Compositional Principles\n\n    Perspective and Focal Logic:\n    No linear perspective. Instead, a floating, shifting, and atmospheric perspective is used. Composition follows vertical hierarchy: higher placement = transcendence or authority; lower = subordination or rootedness. No singular vanishing point; viewers are invited to wander through space morally and intellectually.\n\n    Depth and Flatness:\n    Depth is implied via overlapping planes, tonal washes, and controlled voids. Emphasis is placed on flat compositional balance rather than volumetric modeling.\n\n    Rhythm, Pattern, and Repetition:\n    Natural rhythm is conveyed via repeated tree types (pine, bamboo, plum), water flows, cloud formations, and rock contours. Repetition is never mechanical, but always reflects organic moral order—the harmony of cultivated variation.\n\nIII. Formal and Stylistic Elements\n\n    Geometric and Structural Elements:\n    No rigid geometric grids. Spatial relations are organic, layered, and symbolically aligned. Structures (e.g., bridges, pavilions, paths) are placed not for realism but to express ethical or intellectual transition.\n\n    Ornamental and Decorative Forms:\n    Ornament emerges from natural forms—stylized yet referential. Plum blossoms = resilience; bamboo = integrity; pine = longevity. Decorative form is a semantic system, not mere embellishment.\n\n    Text and Calligraphy:\n    Calligraphy is constitutive, not auxiliary. Inscriptions express poetry, thought, or ethical reflection. Scripts (especially running or semi-cursive) are visually balanced with the painting. Text is placed as dialogue with image, not as label or caption.\n\nIV. Human and Sentient Figures\n\n    Representation Rules:\n    Humans are shown in modest scale, minimal expression, and stylized robes. No dramatization of gesture or facial emotion. Emotional life is inferred from posture, environment, and placement. Figures may be facing away, in study, or absorbed in landscape, suggesting self-cultivation and ethical inwardness.\n    Animals are stylized: birds, cranes, oxen, and fish often appear as moral metaphors.\n\nV. Materiality and Coloration\n\n    Color Palette and Application:\n    Dominantly monochrome ink; when color is used, it is tonal, muted, and symbolic. Typical hues: ink black, umber, pale green, ochre, cinnabar, mineral blue. No harsh contrasts. Color enhances spiritual and ethical tone, not realism.\n\n    Texture and Surface:\n    Texture is conveyed through ink brush technique (皴法: texture strokes), dry/wet modulation, and paper absorbency. Surface remains flat and matte, emphasizing spiritual clarity and control.\n\n    Cosmological and Symbolic Materiality:\n    The materials—brush, ink, paper/silk—are extensions of cultivated self-discipline. Each brushstroke is a moral act, subject to judgment. The void is not absence, but a space of reverence or potential. Ink and emptiness are treated as cosmological opposites in balance.\n\nVI. Temporal and Narrative Dimension\n\n    Representation of Time:\n    Time is seasonal, cyclical, contemplative. Paintings often show signs of time’s passage (e.g., snow, leaf-fall, ripening), but without depicting a moment. Time is encoded in ritual temporality, not photic immediacy.\n\n    Narrative Representation:\n    Narrative is allusive and fragmentary. A painting may hint at a historical moment, literary episode, or philosophical state—but avoids literal storytelling. Narrative space is a landscape of cultivated consciousness.\n\nVII. Ethical-Philosophical Dimension\n\n    Ethical and Aesthetic Norms:\n    Restraint, humility, cultivated spontaneity. No spectacle, no ostentation, no violence. Beauty lies in controlled gesture, relational harmony, and moral sincerity. Art is not for decoration, but for ethical reflection and inward refinement.\n\n    Individualization vs. Generalization:\n    Figures are types, not portraits. The goal is not likeness, but evocation of character through posture and placement. Identity emerges from relation—not autonomy.\n",""],"color":"#232","bgcolor":"#353"},{"id":28,"type":"PrimitiveString","pos":[-191.6328125,207.57847595214844],"size":[736.7470703125,59.96985626220703],"flags":{},"order":7,"mode":0,"inputs":[],"outputs":[{"localized_name":"STRING","name":"STRING","type":"STRING","links":[64]}],"title":"Provide a context: neutral","properties":{"cnr_id":"comfy-core","ver":"0.3.27","Node name for S&R":"PrimitiveString"},"widgets_values":[" 1999 characters maximum output length!"],"color":"#232","bgcolor":"#353"},{"id":9,"type":"SaveImage","pos":[1174.189208984375,-821.47900390625],"size":[939.4619750976562,1040.6234130859375],"flags":{},"order":16,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"localized_name":"images","name":"images","type":"IMAGE","link":9}],"outputs":[],"properties":{"cnr_id":"comfy-core","ver":"0.3.27"},"widgets_values":["ComfyUI",""]},{"id":43,"type":"ai4artsed_openrouter","pos":[622.9384765625,-127.54527282714844],"size":[491.4000244140625,268],"flags":{},"order":12,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"name":"input_prompt","type":"STRING","widget":{"name":"input_prompt"},"link":63},{"name":"input_context","type":"STRING","widget":{"name":"input_context"},"link":64}],"outputs":[{"localized_name":"output","name":"output","type":"STRING","links":[65]}],"properties":{"aux_id":"joeriben/ai4artsed_comfyui","ver":"c18287f8f0f79fa978069f0bceb2b248a507b870","Node name for S&R":"ai4artsed_openrouter"},"widgets_values":["","","Create a detailed prompt IN ENGLISH that stays utterly true to the text and cultural context of the input you received.
