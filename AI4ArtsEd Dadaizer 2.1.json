The composition should feature dadaistic styles, such as:\n- aggressive visual fragmentation, \n- absurd juxtapositions, and a deliberately incoherent layout,\n- photomontage elements using clippings from newspapers, \n- mechanical diagrams, and \n- found objects or readymade references such as a urinal, mannequin limbs, gears, or machine fragments. \nOverlay fragments of text in disjointed, multi-directional typographic styles — mixing fonts, sizes, and orientations — without concern for readability. Use collage and assemblage logic: torn paper edges, layering of incongruent images, visible adhesive textures. Emphasize randomness, chance-based layout, and lack of central perspective. The overall aesthetic should be irreverent, subversive, and saturated with irony, parody, and visual noise. Avoid harmony, symmetry, or traditional artistic composition.

The dog’s torso is reassembled haphazardly: its wavy fur replaced with shredded newspaper strips advertising \"SUNNY HOLIDAYS\" and \"LAKESIDE RETREATS,\" collaged with aggressive overlaps and glue residue. The black harness is reconstructed from industrial belt straps, fused with protruding gears and a miniature urinal dangling absurdly from its side. The head is a photomontage—one eye a bloodshot human eye clipped from a medical diagram, the other a spinning cogwheel. The tongue, a lurid pink scrap of rubber, juts sideways, impaled by a bent nail. The background explodes into dissonant fragments: a splatter of grass-textured wallpaper peeling to reveal blueprints of sewage systems, a lake rendered as a crumpled celeste-blue cellophane sheet stapled to a wood panel, and a bisected sun replaced by a smeared lightbulb filament diagram. Mannequin legs, severed at the thighs, stride aimlessly in the foreground, one crushing a cluster of typographic chaos—\"WOOF\" stenciled upside-down in Gothic font, \"CHAOS REIGNS\" scrawled in childlike cursive over a starburst of ink blots.  \n\n**Palette, Materials, and Elements:**  \nThe palette is a violent clash of bile-yellow newsprint, industrial gunmetal grays, and garish cerise-pink accents. Materials include weathered newspaper, corroded metal plates, torn advertising posters, stained blueprint paper, and translucent plastic shards. Adhesive textures—dried glue streaks, peeling tape, and staples—are exaggerated to disrupt visual flow. Overlaid text fragments in mismatched fonts (blocky sans-serif, spidery script, smeared stencil) spiral outward from the dog’s chest, intersecting with a photostat of a WWI trench map.  \n\n**Elements in Detail:**  \n- **Canine figure:** Segmented torso built from overlapping headlines (\"PARADISE LOST,\" \"MECHANICAL JOY\"), limbs replaced with piston rods and a mannequin paw gripping a fractured leash.  \n- **Harness:** Industrial rubber straps bolted to a dissected typewriter, spools of thread and razor blades entangled within.  \n- **Tongue:** Glossy pink latex strip torn at the edges, pierced by a rusted nail; drips simulated by silver paint streaks.  \n- **Background:** A mosaic of grass-patterned wallpaper merging into a photomontage of a lake refracted through a broken prism, superimposed with a diagram of a sewer pipe.  \n- **Textual chaos:** Phrases like \"ETERNAL FETCH\" and \"WATER = LIES\" collide in multi-directional blocks, some letters inverted or melted into ink splatters.  \n- **Readymade intrusions:** A porcelain urinal fragment lodged in the lower left corner, spilling cogs and newspaper shreds; a mannequin arm emerging from the \"lake,\" clutching a fish skeleton.  \n\nThe work rejects depth, layering jagged, translucent elements to obliterate perspective. Shadows are rendered as harsh black cutouts, ignoring light logic. Every surface bristles with tactile dissonance—glossy varnish clashes with matte newsprint, corroded metal abuts splintered wood. The mood is a feverish critique of postwar absurdity, where nature and industry collapse into futile parody."]},{"id":46,"type":"ShowText","pos":[653.7987670898438,239.02584838867188],"size":[497.8316345214844,246.77740478515625],"flags":{},"order":15,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"name":"text","type":"STRING","widget":{"name":"text"},"link":76}],"outputs":[{"localized_name":"STRING","name":"STRING","shape":6,"type":"STRING","links":null}],"properties":{"cnr_id":"comfyui-show-text","ver":"1.0.2","Node name for S&R":"ShowText"},"widgets_values":["","Okay, here is a Stable Diffusion 3.5 prompt crafted according to your specifications, based *only* on the provided context description of the Dada artwork.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nChaotic Dada photomontage, collage aesthetic.
