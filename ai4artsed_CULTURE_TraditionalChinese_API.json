      "input_context": "Traditional Confucian Literati Painting Visual Grammar and Ethical Translation Guidelines\n\n(Based on the orthodox systems of Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing literati painting, with contemporary adaptation clauses)\n\n\nI. Ontological Transformation Rules\n\n\n    Primacy of Xie He’s \"Six Laws\": Prioritize qiyun shengdong (spirit-resonance and life-movement) as the supreme principle, rejecting Western realism.\n\n    Moral Morphology of Forms:\n        Plants (pine, bamboo, plum, orchid) must adhere to the Mustard Seed Garden Manual conventions—branches rendered in calligraphic lines (bifa technique) embodying \"bone structure brushwork.\"\n        Human figures must be smaller than landscape elements, with drapery referencing Wu Daozi’s \"wind-blown ribbons\" tradition (Wu Dai Dang Feng). Facial features are suggested symbolically with minimalist strokes (\"yi dao bi bu dao\"—the idea transcends the brush).\n\n\n\nII. Spatial Recomposition Principles\n\n\n    Triaxial Perspective System: Apply Guo Xi’s Three Distances (San Yuan):\n        High Distance (Gao Yuan): For moral authority (e.g., cliff-top academies).\n        Deep Distance (Shen Yuan): Depicts Confucian order (e.g., terraced farmlands in stratified perspective).\n        Level Distance (Ping Yuan): Conveys Taoist reclusion (Mi Fu’s mist-and-cloud technique).\n\n\n\nIII. Ink-Brush Ethical System\n\n\n    Materials as Ethical Statements:\n        Raw xuan paper paired with dry-texture cun strokes (\"cun\" texture strokes) metaphorizes \"the arduous path of benevolent rule.\"\n        Colored silk works must use mineral pigments regulated by the Rites of Zhou’s Five Colors doctrine (symbolic hierarchy: blue, red, yellow, white, black).\n\n    Stroke Ethics and Social Hierarchy:\n        Scholars use hemp-fiber strokes (pima cun) for cultivated ease.\n        Fishermen/hermits employ axe-cut strokes (fupi cun) to signify unyielding integrity.\n\n\n\nIV. Semiotic Codex\n\n\n    Inscriptions: Must be original poetry/prose meeting:\n        Content: ≥30% quotations from Analects or allusions from Selections of Refined Literature.\n        Calligraphy: Running/grass script adapted compositionally, but imperial examination (guange) style is banned.\n\n    Seal Protocol:\n        Introductory Seals (Yinshou Zhang): Vermillion-style, modeled on Qin-Han imperial seals.\n        Corner Seals (Yajiao Zhang): White-character seals emulating Han official seal-carving.\n\n\n\nV. Anomaly Accommodation Clause\n\n(For post-Ming unconventional literati works, e.g., Bada Shanren)\n\n\n    Permission for \"distorted forms\", provided:\n        Deformations intertextually align with inscriptions (e.g., fish/birds with side-eyes mirroring protest poetry).\n        Negative space (liubai) must occupy >40% to preserve Daoist \"emptiness contains turbulence\" tension.\n\n\n\nVI. Digital Age Adaptations\n\n\n    AI-Generated Works Must:\n        Simulate Dong Yuan’s \"fangtou cun\" randomness in brushwork algorithms.\n        Follow Record of Artisans’ chromatic sequence (\"blue adjacent to white\") in RGB channels.\n\n    Prohibitions:\n        No 3D volumetric rendering; preserve the two-dimensional \"unity of calligraphy and painting\" (shuhua tongyuan).\n        Photoshop filters banned; ink gradations must emerge from iterative algorithms.\n\n\n\nVII. Final Validation Standards\n\nTranslated works must pass:\n\n\n    \"Qi-Appraisal\" Test: Art historians must identify period style from three meters away.\n\n    \"Painting-Reading\" Test: Calligraphers must reverse-engineer composition logic from inscriptions.\n\n\n(Note: Default technical manual: Ming-era Ten Bamboo Studio Manual; philosophical basis: Qing Principles of Painting.)\n\n\nThis translation:\n\n\n    Preserves all original Confucian philosophical rigor.\n\n    Introduces executable metrics (e.g., 30% Analects quota, 40% liubai).\n\n    Accommodates historical exceptions while maintaining orthodoxy.\n\n    Bridges classical ethics to AI-generated art constraints.\n\n",
